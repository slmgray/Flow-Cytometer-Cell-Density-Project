# Flow-Cytometer-Cell-Density-Project

#To Do List 01-21-2021

- figure out lab times
- set time blocks for cellometer work
- look at BIOSCI courses pinned
- add data file/ counts,  cellometer protocol, flow cy protocol, experimental plan from google docs, and convert google sheets for haemocytometer counts as CSV file
- add to do list on README
once R stats are done also put markdown in
- schedule haemocytometer time to keep up with cellometer

- metadata markdown file explain what happened to each coral (diluted or not)

- *****book cellometer time to do 6 samples that have already been counted by hemocytometer so we can compare****


2021-01-26 meeting agenda:  
- Booked cellometer time @Sierra?  
- Convert flow cy lab plan and experimental plan PDFs to .md @Sierra  
- In haemocytometer cell counts: 1.) move notes column from first column to last and clarify which samples were diluted vs. not diluted 2.) Add # of squares counted column (DONE 20210129 SG) 3.) fill blank cells with NA (DONE 20210129 SG) 4.) calculate mean, standard deviation, and CV for each coral. @Sierra  
- Which samples do we still need haemocytometer counts for?  
- Flowjo update from @Hannah?

3 corals for *M. cap*, *P. acuta*, *Porites spp*, *E5 corals*  
- Emma will get all samples ready for Sierra to count on haemocytometer  
- @Sierra book times in the lab for these counts - are you added to lab calendar?

2021-01-27 Meeting Notes:  
- 1-1.5 mL aliquotes for FlowCy  
- While waiting for Hollies response Emma will give more species/samples for hemocyotmeter counts  
- Emma tell Sierra when samples are set aside  
- Minimum count for each species is 3 samples  
- Sierra email Maggie for access to TeamUP

2021-01-29: Emma set aside samples for Sierra to count on the haemocytometer. See photos below of where they are. @Sierra please see the Sample-Metadata csv sheet I added and fill in the Mcap information we have and add a 'yes' to the samples when you have counted them on each method. @Hannah can you add a 'yes' to the samples that you counted on the flow cy? Thank you!

The samples from Mo'orea from the E5 project are in the below photographed box labeled Strand. **We will start with cellometer counts for these first. They are stored in formalin, @Sierra make sure formalin is okay to put on a cellometer slide before you start these counts.** Wait to hear back from Emma on who will be doing the haemocytometer counts.

2021-01-31: Emma emailed Hannah an alternative software (BD Accuri C6+) to analyze events/ul from the flow cy file. Erin Roberts uses flow cytometry to get cell counts using a flow cytometer from the NOAA in Connecticut. This only works on Windows. There are several windows computers in lab.

2021-02-03: Sierra took haemocytometer counts for two P.acuta samples and will finish the other three on Friday. Sierra emailed Hollie about cellometer availability next week and will know soon if I will go in next week.

2021-02-05: Sierra finished hemocytometer counts on the five P. acuta samples and updated the csv file of hemocytometer counts.

2021-02-10: meeting notes  
- @Sierra will count the E5 samples on the haemocytometer.   
- @Hannah will check out the new flowcy software from Erin Roberts and email C. Voolstra for their protocol for the same flow cytometer.  
- Sierra got quote from Bill -- @Sierra can you make a cost breakdown markdown document on our repo? With all of the costs for each method.  
- @Emma will get haemocy counts from Kev  
- Waiting on Kim to book cellometer time.  
- @Sierra can you add the Porites sample information to the metadata.xlsx from the samples that Kev put in that box?    

2021-02-17: Sierra Cellometer update
- Went to cellometer training on Monday 02-15 and will attach pictures of samples I ran. A big issue is the correct focusing so that you can see both the brightfield and fluorescence clearly. It looked like there were two different kinds of fluorescence F1 and F2, so next time I might try and use F2. In regards to the different fluorescence, another issue that you will see in the images was that in the brightfield (similar to what you see on a hemocytometer) I could see there cells clearly, but then when I switched over to the fluro only about half of them fluoresce. So I believe that is another hiccup that we'll need to sort out. I am thinking about getting in touch with Kim about going in again either Friday or Monday, probably more like Monday so we could chat about what we should do, and maybe if one of you wanted to come in with me to see it to?

- I have not measured the E5 samples yet on the hemocytometer, I can do that in the next week or so, and @Emma are the Porites samples from Kev the samples in formalin, I can find them in lab when I go in to count the E5 samples.
- I started a cost breakdown md but am not sure about some numbers if @Hannah could look into the costs of flow cy costs that would be great, I looked in the Flow Cy Lab Plan and found a little bit of info.

2021-02-22 E. Strand response to notes above:  
- Kevin's samples have already been counted on the haemocytometer, so these will only need the cellometer counts. He will put those aside this week. They will be in the -20C freezer with the other samples we have.      
- Yes, counts the E5 samples in formalin this week.  
- Yes, go back in and try any options you can and get a reading for all of them. Can you put the cells per mL value from the cellometer counts on the spreadsheet? You can start a trial 1, trial 2 columns or F1 fl, F2 fl columns. Can you go in this week? I won't be able to come in with you this week. Another option is to get in touch with the cellometer people that gave you the protocol and ask for some tips. Their webpage might also have suggestions on how to do this.  

Thank you! You're doing great. Try those other options with the cellometer and have a think about what you think is best to do next.

2021-02-22 S. Gray response to E. Strand
I will try and get back into the CORE this friday, I'll email Kim about her availability. I'll also email Bill (Nexcelom rep) he may have some ideas, good suggestion!

I will get the cellometer counts into the spreadsheet, I was thinking of making the Hemocytometer Cell Counts sheet into one mass csv file separating the different cell count methods, good idea?

2021-02-22 @Sierra -- yes good idea, go for it. The Nexcelom rep that came awhile back was great with helping us so I bet he'd have some ideas for you.

2021-02-24 meeting notes:  
- We will try F2 (red) on Friday 10 am EST. Emma will facetime in so we can do it together.  
- Answer these Q's: 1.) How do these counts compare to haemocytometer? 2.) How much variation is there in the cellometer counts? How many do we have to do per coral? 3.) Do we need to dilute the counts?  
- @Sierra can you start a detailed working protocol for the cellometer? Outlining all software options and settings.
