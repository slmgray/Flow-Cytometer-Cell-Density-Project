# Flow-Cytometer-Cell-Density-Project

#To Do List 01-21-2021

- figure out lab times
- set time blocks for cellometer work
- look at BIOSCI courses pinned
- add data file/ counts,  cellometer protocol, flow cy protocol, experimental plan from google docs, and convert google sheets for haemocytometer counts as CSV file
- add to do list on README
once R stats are done also put markdown in
- schedule haemocytometer time to keep up with cellometer

- metadata markdown file explain what happened to each coral (diluted or not)

- *****book cellometer time to do 6 samples that have already been counted by hemocytometer so we can compare****


2021-01-26 meeting agenda:  
- Booked cellometer time @Sierra?  
- Convert flow cy lab plan and experimental plan PDFs to .md @Sierra  
- In haemocytometer cell counts: 1.) move notes column from first column to last and clarify which samples were diluted vs. not diluted 2.) Add # of squares counted column 3.) fill blank cells with NA 4.) calculate mean, standard deviation, and CV for each coral. @Sierra  
- Which samples do we still need haemocytometer counts for?  
- Flowjo update from @Hannah?

3 corals for *M. cap*, *P. acuta*, *Porites spp*, *E5 corals*  
- Emma will get all samples ready for Sierra to count on haemocytometer  
- @Sierra book times in the lab for these counts - are you added to lab calendar?
