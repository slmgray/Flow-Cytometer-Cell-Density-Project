R Code for coeffcient of variation (CV)

- load in csv of data
- find mean
- find standard deviation
- find standard error
- code for CV

Steps with Hannah's comments
1. load in csv of data
-what is the R function for this?
-make sure the csv file is named something informative

2. find mean.
-List the R function for this. find 1-2 R packages that help you find the mean of different groups

3. find standard deviation
-same comments #2

4. find standard error
-same comments as #2

5. code for CV
-can you be more specific? is there a R package you would use? what is the function for the test?

6. Make a figure
-let's think about what type of figure(s) would be helpful in distinguishing differences in cell counts from different counters. What type of figure might be best (i.e., piechart, boxplot, barplot)? What will go on the x-axis? What will go on the y-axis? What treatment groups are we distinguishing? How will we distinguish them (size, color, etc)

7. Statistics to assess significance between counting methods
-hint, take a look at our december presentation for lab meeting with your stats plans. 
-What was the statistical test we suggested? 
-What is the R function for that test? 
-How do we determine if the data meets the assumptions of the test?
-how do we determine the significance (or lack thereof) of the test?
